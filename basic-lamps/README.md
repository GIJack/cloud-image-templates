Linux Apache Mysql(maria) PHP openSsl
=====================================
LAMPS Stands for:
Linux, Apache, MySQL(pronounced My-Squrriel), PHP and OpenSSL

We have substituted MySQL for community fork of MariaDB

The so called LAMPS stack of Linux Apache, MySQL, PHP, and OpenSSL is a now
obsolete stack of software for web application development. Once upon a time
however, this was the backbone of the world wide web, as they where all Free
software with wide support, that was installable on commodity hardware in the
age where dedicated servers where expensive. Anyone could setup and run a LAMPS
stack in their garage. It scaled reasonably well by 1990s standards and was the
collective workhorse that empowered the rapid growth of the internet in the
1990s.

Designed to run applications written in PHP, and store data in a MySQL database,
this stack is still usable, if antiquated. Being that it is entirely Free as in
both Speech AND Beer, and comparitively powerful and scalable against other
entry level competing applications of the day, it enabled small companies with
big ideas to take off as well as enabled communities to build applications.

Here, it is being used as an example profile as an application stack.
